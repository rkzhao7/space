<h2> earth space</h2><hr>
the region of outer space adjacent to the Earth. The geospace region includes regions of the upper atmosphere, such as the ionosphere and magnetosphere , and the Van Allen radiation belts are also within geospace. The area between Earth's atmosphere and the Moon is sometimes called "Earth-Moon space."

<h2>interplanetary space</h2><hr>
the space within the solar system that surrounds the sun and planets. This region is dominated by the interplanetary medium and extends outward all the way to the heliosphere , where the galactic environment begins to affect the flow of particles that accompany and transcend the sun's magnetic field become dominant. Interplanetary space is defined by the solar wind, the continuous stream of charged particles from the sun that creates a thin atmosphere (called the heliosphere) that stretches billions of miles into space. The particle density in the wind is 5-10 protons /cm 3 and it is moving at a speed of 350-400 km/s  . The distance and intensity of the heliosphere are closely related to the degree of solar wind activity . The significance of the discovery of exoplanets since 1995 is that other stars also have the ability to have their own interplanetary medium

<h2>intergalactic space</h2><hr>
the space with matter and the space between galaxies. Intergalactic space is very close to a complete vacuum , but there is usually still free dust and debris. Between clusters of galaxies, the space called voids is an almost complete vacuum . Some theories hold that the density of one hydrogen atom per cubic meter is equivalent to the average density of the universe [9] [10] . However, the density of the universe is clearly not uniform; its density ranges from very high in galaxies (including in galaxies with high-density structures such as planets, stars, and black holes ) to very low in vast voids , a density well below the cosmic average.
